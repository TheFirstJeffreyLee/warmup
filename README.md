warmup
======
so yea theres a multitude of repeating files and stuff that arent in my directory anymore. due to my lack of knowledge of git, i didnt know how to fix that. for this reason i will tell you from my git where the correct files are.
models.py: login/models.py
views.py: login/views.py
login.html: login/templates/login/login.html
urls.py: mysite/urls.py
